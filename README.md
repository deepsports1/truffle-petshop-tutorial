In this tutorial (#2 in my journey to learn more about Crypto development), I became more familiar with `truffle`, a key part of the development toolchain, as well as general local development (using Ganache).

Specifically, I learned about the typical workflow:
- `truffle test`
- `truffle compile`
- `truffle migrate` -- as well as some more about running migrations.

To expand on the topic of migrations, I added one small bit of functionality in the previous commit: I print out the last completed migration from the Migration smart contract.
